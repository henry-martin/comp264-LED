# comp324-LED
Voice Control Using Python
Will include an Email Sender, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Note Taker
A problem we are trying to solve is accessibility for everyone. Those who are physically impaired could use the voice controls. 
We did not get the right version of the Google Assistant or HDMI cable for our Raspberry Pi
Therefore, we could not do our original idea (Controlling LEDs with our voice)
We decided to continue with the voice control/speech recognition aspect, except with different types of apps such as the tic tac toe game.
